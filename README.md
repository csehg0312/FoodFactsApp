## Food Facts App Product Browser

This project is a simple Vue.js application that utilizes the Open Food Facts API to fetch product information. It uses Vite as a build tool and a Node.js backend for potential future functionalities.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system ([URLnodejs org])
2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csehg0312/FoodFactsApp.git
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd FoodFactsApp
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server at http://localhost:5173 by default.

└── vite.config.js          # Vite configuration file
```

### Using the Application

Open http://localhost:5173 in your web browser. You should see a basic interface for searching and displaying product information from the Open Food Facts API.

**Current functionalities might be limited (depending on implementation) but could include:**

- Searching for products by name or barcode.
- Displaying basic product information like name, brand, category, and ingredients.

### Development

For development, changes made to the source code will be reflected automatically in the browser thanks to Vite's hot module replacement.

### Deployment

For deployment, you can build the application for production using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` folder, which can be deployed to a web server.

### Additional Notes

- This is a basic setup and functionalities might need further implementation.
- Consider adding error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
- Refer to the official documentation for Vue.js ([https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction)), Vite ([https://vitejs.dev/guide/](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)), Open Food Facts API ([https://world.openfoodfacts.org/files/api-documentation.html](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/files/api-documentation.html)), and Node.js ([URLnodejs org]) for further details and learning resources.
